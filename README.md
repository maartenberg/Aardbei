# Aardbei, "sprankelprachtig aan- en afmeldsysteem"

Aardbei is a tool meant to simplify signing up for many activities organized
within the same group of people.
The organizers of the activities can set when the activity starts and ends,
a description and location, and can set a deadline for signing up after which
only the organizers can change the information, and remind people who haven't
responded yet automatically at a set time.

Planned features:

* Random distribution of participants of an activity into subgroups
* Automatic information email to organizers of activities

# Screenshots
